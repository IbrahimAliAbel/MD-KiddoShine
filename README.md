<h1>Mobile Application</h1>
  <p>The project involved developing an Android app with a focus on user experience that suits the target market. We designed a simple and attractive interface using XML layout, and ensured efficient data handling through view models, adapters, and Retrofit for smooth API communication. In addition, we integrated Model-View-ViewModel architecture in our project. ViewModel maintains data consistency despite lifecycle changes, while Repository manages data flow between views and data sources. We also used Room Database for efficient local data storage and secure offline access. Overall, this project not only provides a visually appealing application, but also is efficient in data management, responsive to user interaction, and prioritizes data security so that it can be used optimally.
